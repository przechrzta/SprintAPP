# SprintAPP
This is application created for my thesis, which topic was "Mobile application supporting car repair shop work schedule organization".
The application has two user groups, the car repair shop owner, and the car owner - car repair shop client. The application enables clients to communicate with the car repair shop,
setting appointments without the need of calling the car repair shop and being notified about finished repairs, keeps track of past repairs and services. The application enables car repair
shop owner/manager to manage the calendar, accept and set appointments, view car repair history, and contact clients/car owners.
